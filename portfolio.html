        <h3><mark>Game Description</mark></h3>
        <p><mark>This is a "cursor" game where the user moves the cursor around the map
        <br>to reach the finish line without touching anything yellow. The timer
        <br>is set to 120 seconds and decreases by one every second. The amount
        <br>of time you finish is the amount of points you get. When the player
        <br>reaches the second and third round, the randomness occurs when the
        <br>yellow sprites move randomly and tries to tag the user. If the player
        <br>touches yellow, they automatically lose. The rounds get harder since
        <br>there are more yellow objects to avoid each round. If the user finishes all
        <br>the rounds, there is a bonus round at the end. The bonus round consists
        <br>of three questions that the user has to answer by choosing the correct
        <br>path and not touch yellow at the same time. Each correct answer is
        <br>plus 100 points. If the user chooses the wrong path, they lose.</mark></p>
        <h3><mark>Game Reflection</mark></h3>
        <p><mark>I was inspired to make a game based on the "if touch color ?" block
        <br>after finding exploring the different blocks in Scratch. Two successful
        <br>points was that I was able to reuse the same rules of not touching yellow
        <br>for different maps and different types of rounds and that I was able
        <br>to manage a bunch of different sprites that popped up during different
        <br>rounds. Two obstacles that I face was keeping track of the number of
        <br>sprites and coming up with different maps. I overcame the first obstacles
        <br>by using a lot of "broadcast" blocks and overcame the second obstacles
        <br>by searching up different types of mini games online. If I had more
        <br>time, I would create more rounds and add better visuals and sounds.
        <br>An, important algorithm that contributes significantly to the game
        <br>was the "not-touching-yellow" rule. The game was made based on this
        <br>rule since the user can only win by not touching yellow.</mark></p>

        <h1 id = "cyoa"><mark>CYOA: Journey to Pynsthena</mark></h1>
        <p><mark>My story is about the player and a healer, named Jayden, who goes on 
        <br>a journey home after guarding a caravan of people. Using their gold,
        <br> meal packs, and healing potions, they go on an adventure that depends
        <br> on the user to determine their fate.
        <br>
        <br>Amy and I made a program using a flowchart to plan out our story. We
        <br> split the program into two parts: I coded everything that happened 
        <br>if the user chose to kill the wolf (kill_wolf()) while Amy coded everything
        <br> that happened if the user tamed the wolf (tame_wolf()). We coded and
        <br> linked each corresponding scene to each other and tested the entire
        <br> code at the end and looked for errors. Some loops that we had were 
        <br>the reset loop and the invalid input loop. We used the for loop to 
        <br> create a loop that allowed the user to reset the program without 
        <br>having to press run and used the while loop to allow the user to type
        <br> a valid answer to continue to the next scene. Two problems that I 
        <br>had were that the amount of gold, healing potions, and meal packs 
        <br>didn't add up and that the next scene wasn't playing. I resolved the
        <br>first problem by using variables to keep track of the amount and 
        <br>resolved the second problem by going through all the different
        <br> scenes and choices and checking to make sure they led to the correct
        <br> scene.
        <br>Organizing the scenes into different functions was useful since it 
        <br>removed duplicates of the same scene. Also, it helps keep track of which
        <br> block of code is which scene, making it easier to read.
        <br>Two CYOA stories that I liked were "Benny's Adventures" and "Plankton
        <br>Strikes Back" since they were really original and we were only able 
        <br>to have time to read two other stories.</mark></p>
